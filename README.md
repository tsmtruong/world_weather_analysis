# World Weather Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to use Jupyter Notebook and 2 different API Platforms to build a vacation itinerary. First determining the ideal weather locations from a list of 2000 randomized latitudes and longitudes. Then narrowing it down to the cities within the client provided ideal temperature range to then plan out a full vacation with 4 stops as well as hotel accomodation.
